# Random_Forest_Classification
Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction.A large number of relatively uncorrelated models (trees) operating as a committee will outperform any of the individual constituent models.
